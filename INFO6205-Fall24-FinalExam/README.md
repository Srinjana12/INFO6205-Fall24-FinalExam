## Problem Statement
There are two problems to solve.
First, get F(n): the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence,
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).

Second, calculate the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers using the method you already implemented.

Note that you must handle the "corner" cases correctly.

**Example 1:**
- **Input** n = 2
- **Output** 1
- **Explanation** F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

**Example 2:**
- **Input** n = 3
- **Output** 2
- **Explanation** F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

**Example 3:**
- **Input** n = 4
- **Output** 3
- **Explanation** F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.

**Constraints:**
-   `0 <= n <= 92`
